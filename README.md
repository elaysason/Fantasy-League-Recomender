# fantasy-league-recomender

Our fanasy league project. In this project we used random forest and timeseires in order to preidct the number of points each player will get in the following game. This was used in order to be used as a helpper for the user we he wants to pick the best player or make changes to his team.

The proejct is a jupyter notebook and therefore it just need to to run cell by cell.
